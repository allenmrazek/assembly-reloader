- make sure ScenarioModules that should only be added to specific game type are and we don't accidentally create them where they shouldn't be

- investigate: [Error]: Loaded Scenario definitions already contains a scenario with name 'NoisyScenarioModule'

- interception on nested types likely doesn't work

- intercept calls to AddonLoader.StartAddons ?


- Insert tracking code (especially for ScenarioModules, MonoBehaviours marked with KSPAddon (or KSPAddon-derived), etc) so we can intelligently destroy them on reload

- Insert tracking code for GameEvent registrations so we can remove any that get missed when plugin is unloaded, usually due to forgetfulness or an exception being thrown in destruction code

- Verify that reloadable plugins aren't already loaded by the game (for example: TestProject.dll existing alongside TestProject.dll.reloadable in GameData which will break the whole thing unless TestProject.dll is uninstalled first)

- check for changed reloadable dependencies; reload them also

- resolve reloadable dependencies

- update moduleRef and associated configs for unloaded/packed PartModule instances

- clear module snapshots on GameDatabase reload

- bugfix: reloading database might change GameData dir instance, causing us to point to an old "snapshot" of disk contents

- bugfix: reloading while in editor with parts that have UI elements sometimes causes duplicate PartModules to exist on the ship

- bugfix: module info isn't updated (it's created by PartLoader and then never touched afterwards, might cause NRE if PartModule implements IModuleInfo)

- bugfix: set AssemblyLoader.LoadedAssembly dataPath, used by GetPathByType?

- insert stock bug: apparently PartModule.OnInitialize is not run for the first part placed in the editor (wtf?)
