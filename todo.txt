- Insert tracking code (especially for ScenarioModules, MonoBehaviours marked with KSPAddon (or KSPAddon-derived), etc) so we can intelligently destroy them on reload

- Insert tracking code for GameEvent registrations so we can remove any that get missed when plugin is unloaded, usually due to forgetfulness or an exception being thrown in destruction code

- Verify that reloadable plugins aren't already loaded by the game (for example: TestProject.dll existing alongside TestProject.dll.reloadable in GameData which will break the whole thing unless TestProject.dll is uninstalled first)

- check for changed reloadable dependencies; reload them also
